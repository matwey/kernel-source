Subject: [PATCH 5/5] ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow
Git-commit: 883a1d49f0d77d30012f114b2e19fc141beb3e8e
Patch-mainline: 3.16-rc2
References: CVE-2014-4656,bnc#883795

The ALSA control code expects that the range of assigned indices to a control is
continuous and does not overflow. Currently there are no checks to enforce this.
If a control with a overflowing index range is created that control becomes
effectively inaccessible and unremovable since snd_ctl_find_id() will not be
able to find it. This patch adds a check that makes sure that controls with a
overflowing index range can not be created.
