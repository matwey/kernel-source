Subject: [PATCH] md/raid1,raid10: fix deadlock with freeze_array()
Patch-mainline: v3.9-rc4
References: 813889

When raid1/raid10 needs to fix a read error, it first drains
all pending requests by calling freeze_array().
This calls flush_pending_writes() if it needs to sleep,
but some writes may be pending in a per-process plug rather
than in the per-array request queue.

When raid1{,0}_unplug() moves the request from the per-process
plug to the per-array request queue (from which
flush_pending_writes() can flush them), it needs to wake up
freeze_array(), or freeze_array() will never flush them and so
it will block forever.

So add the requires wake_up() calls.

This bug was introduced by commit
   f54a9d0e59c4bea3db733921ca9147612a6f292c
for raid1 and a similar commit for RAID10, and so has been present
since linux-3.6.  As the bug causes a deadlock I believe this fix is
suitable for -stable.
