Shamelessly copied from dchinner's:
ad650f5b xfs: fallback to vmalloc for large buffers in xfs_attrmulti_attr_get
    
xfsdump uses a large buffer for extended attributes, which has a
kmalloc'd shadow buffer in the kernel. This can fail after the
system has been running for some time as it is a high order
allocation. Add a fallback to vmalloc so that it doesn't require
contiguous memory and so won't randomly fail while xfsdump is
running.

This was done for xfs_attrlist_by_handle but
xfs_compat_attrlist_by_handle (the 32-bit version) needs the same
attention.
