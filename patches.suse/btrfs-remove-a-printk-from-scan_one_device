Subject: btrfs: remove a printk from scan_one_device
Git-commit: 2d8946c59743bc635a5e5701e6ef8e71e0a16ab7
Patch-mainline: v3.9-rc1

Dave pointed out that he saw messages from btrfs although there was no
such filesystem on his computers. The automatic device scan is called on
every new blockdevice if the usual distro udev rule set is used. The
printk introduced in 6f60cbd3ae442c was a remainder from copying
portions of code from btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb which is used under
different conditions and the warning makes sense there.
