Subject: Btrfs: fix wrong outstanding_extents when doing DIO write
Git-commit: 172a50497ffaf84d60dff37fbeb03894268fe5c2
Patch-mainline: v3.9-rc1

When running the 083th case of xfstests on the filesystem with
"compress-force=lzo", the following WARNINGs were triggered.
  WARNING: at fs/btrfs/inode.c:7908
  WARNING: at fs/btrfs/inode.c:7909
  WARNING: at fs/btrfs/inode.c:7911
  WARNING: at fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:4510
  WARNING: at fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:4511

This problem was introduced by the patch "Btrfs: fix deadlock due
to unsubmitted". In this patch, there are two bugs which caused
the above problem.

The 1st one is a off-by-one bug, if the DIO write return 0, it is
also a short write, we need release the reserved space for it. But
we didn't do it in that patch. Fix it by change "ret > 0" to
"ret >= 0".

The 2nd one is ->outstanding_extents was increased twice when
a short write happened. As we know, ->outstanding_extents is
a counter to keep track of the number of extent items we may
use duo to delalloc, when we reserve the free space for a
delalloc write, we assume that the write will introduce just
one extent item, so we increase ->outstanding_extents by 1 at
that time. And then we will increase it every time we split the
write, it is done at the beginning of btrfs_get_blocks_direct().
So when a short write happens, we needn't increase
->outstanding_extents again. But this patch done.

In order to fix the 2nd problem, I re-write the logic for
->outstanding_extents operation. We don't increase it at the
beginning of btrfs_get_blocks_direct(), instead, we just
increase it when the split actually happens.
