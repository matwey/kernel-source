Subject: Btrfs: various abort cleanups
Git-commit: 54067ae95e1547123fe6ffcf80842e234effd53b
Patch-mainline: v3.10-rc2

I have a broken file system that when it aborts leaves all sorts of accounting
things wrong and gives you lots of WARN_ON()'s other than the abort.  This is
because we're not cleaning up various parts of the file system when we abort.
The first chunks are specific to mount failures, we weren't cleaning up the
block group cached inodes and we weren't cleaning up any transactions that had
been aborted, which leaves a bunch of things laying around.

The second half of this are related to the cleanup parts.  First we don't need
to release space for the dirty pages from the trans_block_rsv, that's all
handled by the trans handles so this is just plain wrong.  The other thing is we
need to pin down extents that were set ->must_insert_reserved for delayed refs.
This isn't so much for the pinning but more for the cleaning up the
cache->reserved counter since we are no longer going to use those reserved
bytes.  With this patch I no longer see a bunch of WARN_ON()'s when I try to
mount this broken file system, just the initial one from the abort.  Thanks,
