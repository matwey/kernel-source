Subject: Btrfs: do not merge logged extents if we've removed them from the tree
Git-commit: 222c81dc3874b4fe98371be665d0447a36447653
Patch-mainline: v3.8-rc7

You can run into this problem where if somebody is fsyncing and writing out
the existing extents you will have removed the extent map from the em tree,
but it's still valid for the current fsync so we go ahead and write it.  The
problem is we unconditionally try to merge it back into the em tree, but if
we've removed it from the em tree that will cause use after free problems.
Fix this to only merge if we are still a part of the tree.  Thanks,
